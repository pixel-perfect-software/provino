# @provino/env-node

The Node test environment: test code sees the worker's own global, and after each file the environment puts the global back exactly as it was, down to property descriptors.

This package is a building block of [Provino](https://github.com/pixel-perfect-software/provino), a test runner that is pre-alpha and not on npm yet. The `provino` package ships every `@provino/*` package inlined in one bundle, so you install `provino`, not this package.

**Versioning:** this package's public API is held to semver before 1.0: its API report is committed in the repository, under `etc/`, and a change to a `@public` signature needs a changeset.
